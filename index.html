  <h6>Through this website, I want to share things that I learnt from you over these past 27 years.</h6>
</div>

<!-- Para 1 -->
<div class="container-fluid bg-2 text-center">
  <p>When I told one of my friends that I am building this for you, he replied saying, 'Man, She means something to you'. I told him, 'My mom is everything to me'. That's how much you mean to me and how much I respect you for everything you've done in mine and Deepu's lives. Without your support, I would have accomplished nothing in my life.</p>
  <div>So, thank you, for making me the man I am today.</div>
  
</div>

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">
  <p>A girl, who is very talented and very bright in her studies had to discontinue her education at the age of 15 because of lack of financial support from her parents. The then culture in her village didn't let her pursue higher studies anymore as well. At the age of 49, she finally decided that she wants a degree to her name and signed up for a degree in Music college, learning Veena, one of her passions from childhood.</p>

  It shows her <mark>DETERMINATION</mark> to chase her dreams and that Age is just a number. That girl is none other than you and I am so proud to see you wake up at 6 in the morning every day to attend your classes.

  <div>Being determined in life to chase your goals is something that I learnt from you.</div>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid bg-1 text-center">
  <p>Life is unfair. Losing your husband at such a young age, when one of your children was 8 and the other was 3, was such a big blow to your future and your dreams. In a country where Male domination is very much prevalent even now, you stood on your feet, ran your husband's business without any previous exposure to it back in the 90s itself without any support from anyone. You infact learnt to drive a car during that time, which was very brave of you.</p>

  It shows your <mark>COURAGE</mark> and that nothing is impossible if you diligently work through tough times. I also want to let you know that 'Every cloud has a silver lining'!

  <div>Being courageous and never being frightened of situations is something that I learnt from you.</div>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid bg-2 text-center">
  <p>Despite being a single parent, you thought ahead and planned your finances properly for my education and Deepu's marriage, without taking even a penny worth of financial support from anyone. There are people with Post Graduate degrees that cannot manage their finances properly and are going bankrupt these days. But, in your case, it shows your <mark>FORESIGHT</mark> and individuality.</p>
  
  <div>Thinking ahead and planning for the future is something that I learnt from you.</div>
  
</div>

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">
  <p>I didn't have shoes until the age of 16. One day, I vexed you to buy me a pair of shoes. You took me to Reebok, bought me 2 pairs of shoes worth 10,000 Rupees back in 2005. When I asked you why did you buy 2 pairs for me, you replied that you went above and beyond your financial capabilities to buy me not 1 but 2 pairs of shoes so that I could go above and beyond my capabilities to study well and excel in my studies. That motivated me so much that as far as I remember, that was the last time you reminded me to take care of my studies. That motivation is what still drives me to achieve greater things in life.</p>

  <div>Trying to be the best in everything I do is something that I learnt from the motivation that you gave at that very moment.</div>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid bg-1 text-center">
  <p>When I was a child, we were at this grocery store once and the lady at the cash counter gave you 500 excess change in return assuming you gave her 1000 Rupees, where as you actually gave her 500 Rupees. You corrected her and gave that 500 back. When I asked why not take that money and come out, you asked me, 'What if someone does the same thing at our shop tomorrow and we lost 5000 Rupees? Imagine how much trouble that cashier would go through after she realized her mistake? If you do good, you get good'</p>

  <div>Being <mark>COMPASSIONATE</mark> for others is something that I learnt from you after that incident.</div>
